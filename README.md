# fishing_game
 A game where you try to win by fishing on an object. It is possible to encounter many obstacles while playing the game; like a shark.

Now I will tell you about the game. We will prepare.
The game is as follows, I set the polar bear as the character. 
He's trying to catch fish in the ocean below on the ice floe. 
But while catching fish, sharks can come out at the same time.
If he catches the shark, he loses the game, and if he catches anything other than fish, he does not get points.
When he fishes, the ice mass underneath grows.
